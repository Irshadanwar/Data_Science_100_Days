# 🧩 Module 2: Data Structures in Python  

Welcome to **Module 2**! Here, we’ll dive deep into the versatile data structures in Python that help you organize, store, and retrieve data efficiently.  

## 🌟 Learning Objectives  
By the end of this module, you’ll:  
- Understand and work with Python **Lists, Tuples, Sets**, and **Dictionaries**.  
- Master basic operations and methods for these data structures.  
- Learn to leverage comprehensions for cleaner, more concise code.  

## 🛠️ Topics Covered  
1. **Lists**: Ordered, mutable collections. Perfect for storing related items.  
2. **Tuples**: Immutable sequences—great for fixed collections.  
3. **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements. Excellent for membership testing.  
4. **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs for fast lookups and mappings.  

## 🎯 Module Goals  
- Efficiently use lists for operations like slicing and comprehension.  
- Utilize tuples for immutable sequences and unpacking.  
- Apply set operations to handle unique data.  
- Harness dictionaries for creating key-value mappings.  

## 🚀 What's Inside?  
This module includes:  
1. A **theory section** with detailed explanations and examples.  
2. **Code examples** and practice problems in Colab format.  
3. A **quiz file** with questions and answers for self-assessment.  

## 🧠 Why Learn These Data Structures?  
- **Lists and Tuples** make it easy to handle sequences of data.  
- **Sets** ensure no duplicates and simplify operations like finding common elements.  
- **Dictionaries** are essential for storing relationships and fast lookups.
