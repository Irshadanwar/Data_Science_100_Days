# 🧩 **Module 2: Data Structures (Day 4-5)**  

Welcome to the exciting world of **Python Data Structures**! 🌟 These are the building blocks of any Python program and are crucial for organizing, storing, and manipulating data. Whether you're handling user inputs, performing mathematical operations, or building complex algorithms, these tools are your best friends!  

By the end of this module, you’ll wield the power of **Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries** like a Python pro. Ready to dive in? Let’s get started! 🚀

## 🌟 **What You’ll Learn in This Module**  

In **Module 2**, we’ll cover:  
1. **Lists**: The versatile, ordered, and mutable collection. Learn slicing, indexing, and list comprehensions.  
2. **Tuples**: Immutable and lightweight. Perfect for fixed data.  
3. **Sets**: Unordered collections for unique items. Explore union, intersection, and difference.  
4. **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs for efficient lookups and mappings.  

By the end of Day 5, you’ll be ready to tackle data-heavy problems with ease and elegance!

### **Day 5: Sets and Dictionaries**  
Today, you’ll explore Python’s unique data types for managing collections: **Sets** and **Dictionaries**.  

- **Sets**:  
  - Basics: Create and manipulate sets.  
  - Operations: Union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.  

- **Dictionaries**:  
  - Basics: Creating, accessing, and modifying key-value pairs.  
  - Advanced: Iteration, comprehensions, and nested dictionaries.  

#### 🎯 **Tasks for Day 5**  
- Write a program to find common elements between two sets `{1, 2, 3, 4}` and `{3, 4, 5, 6}`.  
- Create a dictionary to map numbers (1–5) to their squares using a dictionary comprehension.  
- Write a program to count the frequency of characters in a string.
